# Admin Appointments - Rejected Priority Fix

## Problem Identified

The admin appointments page had the same issue as the doctor and staff appointments pages. In the "Cancelled" tab, cancelled appointments were showing before rejected appointments, which is not optimal for admin workflow since rejected appointments require immediate attention and administrative review.

## Solution Applied

Applied the same rejected priority sorting logic that was implemented for the doctor and staff appointments pages to ensure consistency across all user roles and administrative functions.

### **Enhanced Sorting Logic for Admin**

**Before:**
```javascript
} else if (activeTab === 'cancelled') {
  filtered = filtered.filter(app => app.status === 'cancelled' || app.status === 'rejected');
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
} else if (activeTab === 'cancelled') {
  filtered = filtered.filter(app => app.status === 'cancelled' || app.status === 'rejected');
  
  // Sort to show rejected appointments first, then cancelled
  filtered.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a.status === 'rejected' && b.status === 'cancelled') return -1;
    if (a.status === 'cancelled' && b.status === 'rejected') return 1;
    
    // If both have same status, sort by date (newest first)
    const dateA = new Date(`${a.appointment_date}T${a.appointment_time}`);
    const dateB = new Date(`${b.appointment_date}T${b.appointment_time}`);
    return dateB - dateA;
  });
}
```

## How the Sorting Works

### **1. Priority-Based Sorting**
- **Rejected appointments** are shown first (highest priority)
- **Cancelled appointments** are shown after rejected ones
- Ensures admins see the most critical appointments first

### **2. Secondary Sorting by Date**
- Within each status group (rejected/cancelled), appointments are sorted by date
- **Newest appointments first** for better chronological organization
- Helps admins see recent rejections/cancellations at the top

### **3. Complete Cross-Role Consistency**
- **Doctor appointments** - Rejected priority sorting âœ…
- **Staff appointments** - Rejected priority sorting âœ…
- **Admin appointments** - Rejected priority sorting âœ…
- **Unified experience** across all user roles

## Expected Results

### **Before Fix:**
- Cancelled appointments appeared first in admin view
- Rejected appointments were mixed in or appeared later
- Inconsistent with doctor and staff appointments pages
- Hard to identify urgent rejected appointments requiring admin review

### **After Fix:**
- âœ… **Rejected appointments shown first** - Highest priority for immediate attention
- âœ… **Cancelled appointments shown second** - Lower priority but still visible
- âœ… **Newest appointments first** - Within each status group, most recent first
- âœ… **Consistent with all roles** - Same sorting logic across doctor, staff, and admin
- âœ… **Better admin workflow** - Quick identification of rejected appointments

## Benefits for Admins

### **Administrative Workflow:**
- **Immediate visibility** of rejected appointments requiring administrative review
- **Better organization** with priority-based sorting
- **Easier decision making** with logical appointment ordering
- **Consistent experience** with doctor and staff appointments pages

### **Appointment Order (After Fix):**
1. **Rejected appointments** (newest first)
   - Most recent rejected appointments at the top
   - Easy to identify and address urgent administrative issues
   
2. **Cancelled appointments** (newest first)
   - Recent cancellations for reference
   - Lower priority than rejections

## Complete Cross-Role Consistency

### **Unified Experience Across All Roles:**
- **Doctor appointments** - Rejected priority sorting âœ…
- **Staff appointments** - Rejected priority sorting âœ…
- **Admin appointments** - Rejected priority sorting âœ…
- **Consistent behavior** across all user interfaces
- **Same sorting logic** for better team coordination

### **Organizational Benefits:**
- **Consistent workflow** for all healthcare team members
- **Unified priority system** across all interfaces
- **Better coordination** with identical sorting logic
- **Improved patient care** through consistent appointment management
- **Administrative efficiency** with priority-based organization

## Administrative Advantages

### **Enhanced Admin Capabilities:**
- **Priority-based review** of rejected appointments
- **Consistent interface** with clinical staff
- **Better oversight** of appointment management
- **Improved administrative workflow** with logical organization

### **Team Coordination:**
- **Unified experience** for all team members
- **Consistent priority system** across all roles
- **Better communication** with identical sorting logic
