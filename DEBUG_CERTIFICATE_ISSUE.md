# üîç DEBUGGING CERTIFICATE STORAGE ISSUE

## üéØ **CURRENT STATUS**
Based on your screenshot, the `certificates` bucket **DOES EXIST** and is marked as "Public". The issue is likely with storage policies or access permissions.

## üö® **IMMEDIATE FIXES**

### **Step 1: Run the Storage Fix**
Execute this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Execute: fix_certificate_storage.sql
```

### **Step 2: Test Storage Access**
Run this test script to verify everything is working:
```sql
-- Execute: test_storage_access.sql
```

### **Step 3: Check Browser Console**
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Try to upload a certificate
4. Look for specific error messages

## üîç **COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS**

### **Issue 1: Storage Policies Missing**
**Symptoms:** "Could not initialize certificates storage"
**Solution:** Run `fix_certificate_storage.sql`

### **Issue 2: RLS Policies Conflict**
**Symptoms:** "new row violates row-level security policy"
**Solution:** Run `certificate_setup_with_existing_policies.sql`

### **Issue 3: Bucket Access Denied**
**Symptoms:** "Permission denied" or "Bucket not found"
**Solution:** Check bucket permissions in Supabase Dashboard

### **Issue 4: Authentication Issues**
**Symptoms:** "Unauthorized" or "Not authenticated"
**Solution:** Check if user is properly logged in

## üéØ **STEP-BY-STEP DEBUGGING**

### **1. Check Bucket Status**
```sql
-- Run this to verify bucket exists and is public
SELECT 
    name as bucket_name,
    public,
    file_size_limit
FROM storage.buckets 
WHERE name = 'certificates';
```

**Expected Result:**
```
bucket_name  | public | file_size_limit
-------------|--------|-----------------
certificates | true   | 10485760
```

### **2. Check Storage Policies**
```sql
-- Run this to verify storage policies exist
SELECT 
    policyname,
    cmd,
    permissive,
    roles
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'objects' 
AND schemaname = 'storage' 
AND policyname LIKE '%certificate%'
ORDER BY policyname;
```

**Expected Result:** At least 4 policies (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE)

### **3. Check RLS Status**
```sql
-- Run this to verify RLS is enabled
SELECT 
    tablename,
    rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'objects' 
AND schemaname = 'storage';
```

**Expected Result:** `rls_enabled = true`

### **4. Test File Upload**
Try uploading a small image file (‚â§1MB) to test the functionality.

## üîß **QUICK FIXES**

### **If Storage Policies Are Missing:**
```sql
-- Create missing storage policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload certificates" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT TO public
WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'certificates' AND
    auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

CREATE POLICY "Public access to certificates" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'certificates');

CREATE POLICY "Users can update certificates" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE TO public
USING (
    bucket_id = 'certificates' AND
    auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete certificates" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE TO public
USING (
    bucket_id = 'certificates' AND
    auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);
```

### **If RLS Is Disabled:**
```sql
-- Enable RLS on storage.objects
ALTER TABLE storage.objects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### **If Certificate URL Column Missing:**
```sql
-- Add certificate_url column
ALTER TABLE profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS certificate_url TEXT DEFAULT NULL;
```

## üéØ **TESTING CHECKLIST**

### **‚úÖ Pre-Test Requirements:**
- [ ] Certificates bucket exists and is public
- [ ] Storage policies are in place (4 policies minimum)
- [ ] RLS is enabled on storage.objects
- [ ] certificate_url column exists in profiles table
- [ ] User is authenticated

### **‚úÖ Test Steps:**
1. [ ] Log in as any user type
2. [ ] Navigate to profile/settings
3. [ ] Select an image file (‚â§10MB)
4. [ ] Click "Upload Certificate"
5. [ ] Verify upload succeeds
6. [ ] Test certificate removal

### **‚úÖ Success Indicators:**
- [ ] No "Could not initialize certificates storage" error
- [ ] File uploads successfully
- [ ] Certificate appears in preview
- [ ] Success message shown
- [ ] Certificate can be removed

## üöÄ **FINAL SOLUTION**

### **If Everything Else Fails:**
1. **Run the comprehensive fix:**
   ```sql
   -- Execute: fix_certificate_storage.sql
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache and cookies**

3. **Test with a fresh browser session**

4. **Check network tab for specific errors**

## üìû **SUPPORT**

If you're still experiencing issues:
1. **Run the test script** and share the results
2. **Check browser console** for specific error messages
3. **Verify all requirements** in the testing checklist
4. **Contact support** with the specific error messages

**The key is ensuring all storage policies are properly configured for the certificates bucket!**
