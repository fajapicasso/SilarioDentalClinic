# Staff Appointments - Rejected Priority Fix

## Problem Identified

The staff appointments page had the same issue as the doctor appointments page. In the "Cancelled/Rejected" tab, cancelled appointments were showing before rejected appointments, which is not optimal for staff workflow since rejected appointments require immediate attention.

## Solution Applied

Applied the same rejected priority sorting logic that was implemented for the doctor appointments page to ensure consistency across all user roles.

### **Enhanced Sorting Logic for Staff**

**Before:**
```javascript
} else if (activeTab === 'cancelled') {
  filtered = filtered.filter(app => app.status === 'cancelled' || app.status === 'rejected');
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
} else if (activeTab === 'cancelled') {
  filtered = filtered.filter(app => app.status === 'cancelled' || app.status === 'rejected');
  
  // Sort to show rejected appointments first, then cancelled
  filtered.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a.status === 'rejected' && b.status === 'cancelled') return -1;
    if (a.status === 'cancelled' && b.status === 'rejected') return 1;
    
    // If both have same status, sort by date (newest first)
    const dateA = new Date(`${a.appointment_date}T${a.appointment_time}`);
    const dateB = new Date(`${b.appointment_date}T${b.appointment_time}`);
    return dateB - dateA;
  });
}
```

## How the Sorting Works

### **1. Priority-Based Sorting**
- **Rejected appointments** are shown first (highest priority)
- **Cancelled appointments** are shown after rejected ones
- Ensures staff see the most critical appointments first

### **2. Secondary Sorting by Date**
- Within each status group (rejected/cancelled), appointments are sorted by date
- **Newest appointments first** for better chronological organization
- Helps staff see recent rejections/cancellations at the top

### **3. Consistent User Experience**
- **Same logic as doctor appointments** - Consistent behavior across roles
- **Staff and doctor workflows** now have identical priority sorting
- **Unified experience** for all healthcare team members

## Expected Results

### **Before Fix:**
- Cancelled appointments appeared first in staff view
- Rejected appointments were mixed in or appeared later
- Inconsistent with doctor appointments page
- Hard to identify urgent rejected appointments

### **After Fix:**
- âœ… **Rejected appointments shown first** - Highest priority for immediate attention
- âœ… **Cancelled appointments shown second** - Lower priority but still visible
- âœ… **Newest appointments first** - Within each status group, most recent first
- âœ… **Consistent with doctor page** - Same sorting logic across all roles
- âœ… **Better staff workflow** - Quick identification of rejected appointments

## Benefits for Staff

### **Improved Workflow:**
- **Immediate visibility** of rejected appointments requiring attention
- **Better organization** with priority-based sorting
- **Easier decision making** with logical appointment ordering
- **Consistent experience** with doctor appointments page

### **Appointment Order (After Fix):**
1. **Rejected appointments** (newest first)
   - Most recent rejected appointments at the top
   - Easy to identify and address urgent issues
   
2. **Cancelled appointments** (newest first)
   - Recent cancellations for reference
   - Lower priority than rejections

## Cross-Role Consistency

### **Unified Experience:**
- **Doctor appointments** - Rejected priority sorting âœ…
- **Staff appointments** - Rejected priority sorting âœ…
- **Consistent behavior** across all user roles
- **Same sorting logic** for better team coordination

### **Team Benefits:**
- **Consistent workflow** for all healthcare team members
- **Unified priority system** across doctor and staff interfaces
- **Better coordination** with identical sorting logic
- **Improved patient care** through consistent appointment management

The staff appointments page now has the same rejected priority sorting as the doctor appointments page, ensuring a consistent and efficient workflow for all healthcare team members! ðŸŽ¯âœ¨
