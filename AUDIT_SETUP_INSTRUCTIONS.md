# Audit System Setup Instructions

## Why Audit Logs Aren't Displaying

The audit logs are not displaying because the database tables haven't been created yet. The audit system requires specific database tables to store the log data.

## Quick Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create Database Tables

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to the **SQL Editor** tab
3. Copy the contents of `setup_audit_database.sql` 
4. Paste it into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

This will create:
- `audit_logs` table (main table for storing audit events)
- `audit_log_categories` table (for organizing logs by category)
- `audit_log_actions` table (for defining action types)
- `audit_log_reports` table (for report generation)
- `audit_log_settings` table (for configuration)
- All necessary indexes, RLS policies, and triggers

### Step 2: Verify Setup

After running the SQL, you can verify the setup by:

1. Going to your Supabase **Table Editor**
2. Looking for the new `audit_logs` table
3. Checking that it has the correct columns

### Step 3: Test the System

Once the tables are created, the audit logs should start appearing in your admin interface. The system will automatically start logging:

- User logins/logouts
- User profile changes
- Appointment activities
- Payment activities
- And other system events

## What You'll See After Setup

Once the database is set up, you'll see:

1. **Real-time audit logs** in the admin interface
2. **Filtering options** by user, action, module, date range
3. **Detailed log entries** with before/after values
4. **Export capabilities** for reports
5. **Automatic logging** of all system activities

## Troubleshooting

If you still don't see logs after setup:

1. **Check browser console** for any JavaScript errors
2. **Verify RLS policies** are working correctly
3. **Check user permissions** - only admins can view all logs
4. **Run the test script** (`test_audit_system.js`) to verify functionality

## Next Steps

After the audit system is working:

1. **Integrate audit logging** into your existing components
2. **Set up automated reports** for compliance
3. **Configure retention policies** for log cleanup
4. **Train staff** on monitoring audit logs

The audit system will provide comprehensive tracking of all activities in your dental clinic management system, ensuring security and compliance.
