# Queue Duplication Fix

## Problem Identified

The queue management system had **4 separate QueueManagement components**:
1. `src/components/common/QueueManagement.jsx` (shared component)
2. `src/pages/staff/QueueManagement.jsx` (staff-specific)
3. `src/pages/doctor/QueueManagement.jsx` (doctor-specific) 
4. `src/pages/admin/QueueManagement.jsx` (admin-specific)

Each component had its own auto-add logic that independently checked for missing confirmed appointments and added them to the queue. This caused **duplication** because:

- Each role (staff, doctor, admin) had its own copy of the queue management logic
- Each component used its own sessionStorage key (`autoAddProcessed_${todayDate}`)
- When different users accessed their respective queue management pages, each component ran its auto-add logic independently
- The same confirmed appointment would be added to the queue multiple times

## Root Cause

**Multiple independent auto-add processes**: Each QueueManagement component independently:
1. Fetched confirmed appointments for today
2. Checked if they were already in the queue
3. Auto-added missing appointments to the queue
4. Used separate sessionStorage keys that didn't coordinate with each other

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Unified Component Usage
- Updated `src/App.jsx` to use the common `QueueManagement` component for all roles
- Removed imports for separate staff, doctor, and admin queue management components
- All roles now use the same shared component: `src/components/common/QueueManagement.jsx`

### 2. Global SessionStorage Coordination
- Changed sessionStorage key from `autoAddProcessed_${todayDate}` to `globalAutoAddProcessed_${todayDate}`
- This ensures that once appointments are auto-added by any role, they won't be added again by other roles
- Added comments explaining the global coordination

### 3. Code Changes Made

#### In `src/components/common/QueueManagement.jsx`:
```javascript
// Before: Component-specific key
sessionStorage.removeItem('autoAddProcessed');

// After: Global key to prevent duplication across roles
sessionStorage.removeItem('globalAutoAddProcessed');
```

```javascript
// Before: Component-specific key
const autoAddKey = `autoAddProcessed_${todayDate}`;

// After: Global key
const autoAddKey = `globalAutoAddProcessed_${todayDate}`;
```

#### In `src/App.jsx`:
```javascript
// Before: Separate imports
import AdminQueueManagement from './pages/admin/QueueManagement';
import DoctorQueueManagement from './pages/doctor/QueueManagement';
import StaffQueueManagement from './pages/staff/QueueManagement';

// After: Single common component
import CommonQueueManagement from './components/common/QueueManagement';

// All routes now use the same component
<Route path="queue" element={<CommonQueueManagement />} />
```

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates Duplication**: Confirmed appointments are only added to the queue once, regardless of which role accesses the queue management
2. **Consistent Behavior**: All roles see the same queue data and behavior
3. **Maintainability**: Single component to maintain instead of 4 separate ones
4. **Performance**: Reduces redundant database operations and API calls

## Files Modified

- `src/App.jsx` - Updated imports and routes to use common component
- `src/components/common/QueueManagement.jsx` - Updated sessionStorage keys to be global

## Files to Clean Up (Optional)

The following duplicate files can be removed since they're no longer used:
- `src/pages/staff/QueueManagement.jsx`
- `src/pages/doctor/QueueManagement.jsx` 
- `src/pages/admin/QueueManagement.jsx`

## Testing

After this fix:
1. Confirmed appointments should only appear once in the queue
2. All roles (staff, doctor, admin) should see the same queue data
3. Auto-add functionality should work only once per day globally
4. No more duplicate queue entries for the same appointment
