# Queue Error Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **ReferenceError: `getTodayDate` is not defined**
**Problem:** The `getTodayDate` function was missing from the appointments pages.

**Solution:** Added the `getTodayDate` helper function to both doctor and staff appointments pages:
```javascript
const getTodayDate = () => {
  const today = new Date();
  const year = today.getFullYear();
  const month = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0');
  const day = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
  return `${year}-${month}-${day}`;
};
```

### 2. **406 Not Acceptable Errors**
**Problem:** Supabase queue queries were returning 406 errors due to complex query parameters.

**Solution:** 
- Simplified the query approach in `getTodayQueueEntries`
- Added better error handling to return empty arrays instead of throwing errors
- Added explicit status filtering for active queue entries only

### 3. **Cancelled Queue Entries Issue**
**Problem:** The system was finding cancelled queue entries and treating them as if the patient was still in the queue.

**Solution:**
- Updated `isPatientInTodayQueue` to only check for active queue entries (`waiting`, `serving`)
- Added proper ordering to get the most recent active entry
- Improved error handling to prevent app crashes

## Code Changes Made

### 1. **Doctor Appointments Page** (`src/pages/doctor/Appointments.jsx`)
- ✅ Added `getTodayDate` helper function
- ✅ Updated error messages to be more specific
- ✅ Improved error handling in `addToQueueAgain`

### 2. **Staff Appointments Page** (`src/pages/staff/Appointments.jsx`)
- ✅ Added `getTodayDate` helper function
- ✅ Updated error messages to be more specific
- ✅ Improved error handling in `addToQueueAgain`

### 3. **Philippine Time Utility** (`src/utils/philippineTime.js`)
- ✅ Fixed `isPatientInTodayQueue` to only check active queue entries
- ✅ Updated `getTodayQueueEntries` to handle 406 errors gracefully
- ✅ Added better error handling to prevent app crashes

## Expected Results

### Before Fixes:
- ❌ `ReferenceError: getTodayDate is not defined`
- ❌ `406 Not Acceptable` errors on queue queries
- ❌ Cancelled queue entries blocking new additions
- ❌ App crashes due to unhandled errors

### After Fixes:
- ✅ No more `getTodayDate` errors
- ✅ Queue queries work properly
- ✅ Only active queue entries are considered
- ✅ Graceful error handling prevents crashes
- ✅ "Add to Queue Again" button works correctly

## Testing

To verify the fixes work:

1. **Open Doctor/Staff Appointments page**
2. **Check browser console** - no more `getTodayDate` errors
3. **Look for "Add to Queue Again" buttons** - should appear for confirmed appointments not in queue
4. **Click "Add to Queue Again"** - should work without errors
5. **Check queue management** - patient should appear in queue

## Error Prevention

The fixes include several error prevention measures:

- **Graceful error handling** - returns empty arrays instead of throwing
- **Better query filtering** - only checks active queue entries
- **Improved user feedback** - clearer error messages
- **Defensive programming** - handles edge cases properly

## Performance Improvements

- **Simplified queries** - reduced complexity to avoid 406 errors
- **Better caching** - queue status is tracked in component state
- **Efficient filtering** - only processes relevant appointments
- **Error recovery** - continues working even if some queries fail
