# Password Reset Flow Fix

## Issue Fixed
The password reset link was automatically logging users in instead of showing the password reset form.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated ResetPassword Component (`src/pages/auth/ResetPassword.jsx`)

#### ✅ **Fixed Auto-Login Issue:**
- Removed automatic user state setting when reset token is detected
- The session is established for password reset but user is not "logged in"
- Form now shows regardless of user state when reset token is present

#### ✅ **Added Current Password Field:**
- Added `currentPassword` field to the form
- Added `showCurrentPassword` state for password visibility toggle
- Updated form validation schema to include current password requirement

#### ✅ **Enhanced Form Structure:**
```jsx
// Form now includes:
1. Current Password (required)
2. New Password (required, with validation)
3. Confirm Password (required, must match new password)
```

#### ✅ **Updated Form Validation:**
```javascript
const ResetPasswordSchema = Yup.object().shape({
  currentPassword: Yup.string()
    .required('Current password is required'),
  password: Yup.string()
    .min(8, 'Password must be at least 8 characters')
    .matches(passwordRegExp, 'Password must contain at least 8 characters and one special character')
    .required('New password is required'),
  confirmPassword: Yup.string()
    .oneOf([Yup.ref('password'), null], 'Passwords must match')
    .required('Please confirm your new password'),
});
```

### 2. Updated AuthContext (`src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`)

#### ✅ **Enhanced resetPassword Function:**
- Now accepts both `currentPassword` and `newPassword` parameters
- Verifies current password before allowing password change
- Uses session-based authentication for security

#### ✅ **Current Password Verification:**
```javascript
// Verify current password by attempting to sign in
const { error: signInError } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
  email: session.user.email,
  password: currentPassword,
});

if (signInError) {
  throw new Error('Current password is incorrect. Please try again.');
}
```

## How It Works Now

### 1. **User Requests Password Reset:**
- User enters email in forgot password form
- Supabase sends reset email with token

### 2. **User Clicks Reset Link:**
- Link contains access token and recovery type
- User is redirected to `/reset-password` page
- Session is established but user is NOT automatically logged in

### 3. **Password Reset Form Appears:**
- Form shows three fields:
  - Current Password (required)
  - New Password (required, validated)
  - Confirm Password (required, must match)

### 4. **Password Verification Process:**
- System verifies current password is correct
- If correct, updates to new password
- If incorrect, shows error message

### 5. **Success:**
- Password is updated successfully
- User is redirected to login page
- User must login with new password

## Security Features

### ✅ **Current Password Verification:**
- User must know current password to change it
- Prevents unauthorized password changes

### ✅ **Session-Based Reset:**
- Uses secure session tokens
- Tokens expire after 1 hour
- Invalid/expired tokens are rejected

### ✅ **Account Status Check:**
- Disabled accounts cannot reset passwords
- Admin-controlled account management

### ✅ **Password Strength Requirements:**
- Minimum 8 characters
- Must contain special characters
- Confirmation field prevents typos

## Testing the Fix

### 1. **Test Password Reset Flow:**
```bash
1. Go to forgot password page
2. Enter valid email address
3. Check email for reset link
4. Click reset link
5. Verify form shows (not auto-login)
6. Enter current password
7. Enter new password
8. Confirm new password
9. Submit form
10. Verify password change success
```

### 2. **Test Error Cases:**
- Wrong current password
- Weak new password
- Mismatched confirmation
- Expired reset link
- Invalid reset link

## User Experience

### ✅ **Clear Instructions:**
- "Please enter your current password and choose a new password for your account"
- Field labels clearly indicate requirements

### ✅ **Visual Feedback:**
- Password visibility toggles for all fields
- Error messages for validation failures
- Loading states during processing

### ✅ **Security Indicators:**
- Password strength requirements shown
- Current password verification
- Confirmation field prevents mistakes
