# Button State Fix - "Add to Queue Again" Not Hiding

## Problem Analysis

The "Add to Queue Again" button is working (shows success toast "Patient added to queue as #546"), but the button remains visible and clickable after adding the patient to the queue. This indicates a **button state update issue**.

## Root Cause

The issue is that the `patientsInQueue` state is not being properly updated after successfully adding a patient to the queue, so the button doesn't hide.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Enhanced Queue Status Checking with Debugging**
```javascript
const checkPatientsInQueue = async () => {
  try {
    console.log('🔄 Checking patients in queue...');
    const todayAppointments = appointments.filter(apt => 
      apt.appointment_date === getTodayDate() && 
      apt.status === 'confirmed'
    );
    
    console.log(`📅 Found ${todayAppointments.length} confirmed appointments for today`);
    
    const queueStatus = new Set();
    for (const appointment of todayAppointments) {
      console.log(`🔍 Checking patient ${appointment.patient_id} (${appointment.patient_name})...`);
      const isInQueue = await isPatientInTodayQueue(supabase, appointment.patient_id);
      if (isInQueue) {
        console.log(`✅ Patient ${appointment.patient_id} is in queue`);
        queueStatus.add(appointment.patient_id);
      } else {
        console.log(`❌ Patient ${appointment.patient_id} is NOT in queue`);
      }
    }
    
    console.log(`📊 Queue status updated:`, Array.from(queueStatus));
    setPatientsInQueue(queueStatus);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error checking patients in queue:', error);
  }
};
```

### 2. **Improved Button State Update After Queue Addition**
```javascript
if (result.success) {
  toast.success(`Patient added to queue as #${result.queueNumber}`);
  // Immediately update the queue status
  setPatientsInQueue(prev => new Set([...prev, appointment.patient_id]));
  console.log(`✅ Patient ${appointment.patient_id} added to queue, updating button state...`);
  
  // Force refresh the queue status after a short delay
  setTimeout(async () => {
    console.log('🔄 Refreshing queue status after addition...');
    await checkPatientsInQueue();
  }, 2000);
} else {
  toast.error(result.message || 'Failed to add patient to queue');
}
```

### 3. **Button Visibility Logic**
The button should be hidden when:
```javascript
{!patientsInQueue.has(appointment.patient_id) && (
  <button onClick={() => addToQueueAgain(appointment)}>
    Add to Queue Again
  </button>
)}
```

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix:
- ✅ Button click works (shows success toast)
- ❌ Button remains visible after adding to queue
- ❌ Button can be clicked multiple times
- ❌ No console debugging information

### After Fix:
- ✅ Button click works (shows success toast)
- ✅ Button disappears after adding to queue
- ✅ Button cannot be clicked again
- ✅ Console shows detailed debugging information
- ✅ Button state updates automatically

## Testing Steps

### 1. **Check Console Logs**
Open browser console and look for:
- `🔄 Checking patients in queue...`
- `📅 Found X confirmed appointments for today`
- `🔍 Checking patient [ID] (Name)...`
- `✅ Patient [ID] is in queue` or `❌ Patient [ID] is NOT in queue`
- `📊 Queue status updated: [array of patient IDs]`

### 2. **Test Button Behavior**
1. **Before clicking**: Button should be visible for patients not in queue
2. **After clicking**: 
   - Success toast appears
   - Console shows "Patient added to queue, updating button state..."
   - Button should disappear after 2 seconds
   - Console shows "Refreshing queue status after addition..."

### 3. **Verify Button State**
- **Visible**: When `!patientsInQueue.has(appointment.patient_id)` is true
- **Hidden**: When `patientsInQueue.has(appointment.patient_id)` is true

## Debug Commands

Run these in browser console to debug:

```javascript
// Check current button state
console.log('Current patientsInQueue:', Array.from(patientsInQueue));

// Check specific patient
const patientId = 'ccf43fef-4671-45f7-9d1c-e649657a9fc8';
console.log('Patient in queue:', patientsInQueue.has(patientId));

// Test button state logic
testButtonState();
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/pages/doctor/Appointments.jsx`**
   - Enhanced `checkPatientsInQueue` with debugging
   - Improved `addToQueueAgain` with immediate state update
   - Added forced refresh after queue addition

2. **`src/pages/staff/Appointments.jsx`**
   - Enhanced `checkPatientsInQueue` with debugging
   - Improved `addToQueueAgain` with immediate state update
   - Added forced refresh after queue addition

3. **`test_button_state.js`**
   - Test script to verify button state logic

## Key Improvements

1. **Immediate State Update**: `setPatientsInQueue` is called immediately after successful queue addition
2. **Forced Refresh**: `checkPatientsInQueue` is called after 2 seconds to ensure state is accurate
3. **Enhanced Debugging**: Console logs show exactly what's happening with button state
4. **Better Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases

## Expected Results

After the fix:
- ✅ "Add to Queue Again" button works correctly
- ✅ Button disappears after successful addition
- ✅ Button state updates automatically
- ✅ Console shows detailed debugging information
- ✅ No more multiple clicks on the same button

The key fix is ensuring that the `patientsInQueue` state is properly updated both immediately and after a refresh, which will make the button hide correctly after adding a patient to the queue.
