# Queue Fetching Fix - Doctor-Specific Filtering

## Problem Fixed
The queue fetching was not working properly for confirmed appointments today, and it was showing appointments from all doctors instead of just the current doctor.

## Changes Made

### 1. Staff Queue Management (`src/pages/staff/QueueManagement.jsx`)
**Fixed appointment fetching to filter by current doctor:**
```javascript
// Before: Fetched all appointments
.eq('appointment_date', todayDate)
.in('status', ['confirmed', 'appointed'])

// After: Only fetch appointments for current doctor
.eq('appointment_date', todayDate)
.eq('doctor_id', user.id) // Only fetch appointments for the current doctor
.in('status', ['confirmed', 'appointed'])
```

**Added queue filtering by doctor:**
```javascript
// Filter queue entries to only show those for the current doctor
const currentQueue = (queueData || []).filter(queueEntry => {
  // If the queue entry has an appointment_id, check if the appointment belongs to the current doctor
  if (queueEntry.appointment_id) {
    const appointment = Object.values(processedAppointments).find(apt => apt.id === queueEntry.appointment_id);
    return appointment && appointment.doctor_id === user.id;
  }
  // If no appointment_id, include it (walk-in patients)
  return true;
});
```

### 2. Doctor Queue Management (`src/pages/doctor/QueueManagement.jsx`)
**Applied the same fixes as staff queue management:**
- Added doctor filtering to appointment fetching
- Added queue filtering by doctor
- Ensured only current doctor's appointments are shown

### 3. Admin Queue Monitoring (`src/pages/admin/QueueMonitoring.jsx`)
**No changes needed** - Admin should see all queue entries from all doctors.

## How It Works Now

### For Staff/Doctor Users:
1. **Appointment Fetching**: Only fetches confirmed/appointed appointments for the current doctor
2. **Queue Filtering**: Only shows queue entries that belong to the current doctor
3. **Auto-Integration**: Automatically adds missing confirmed appointments to the queue
4. **Walk-in Patients**: Walk-in patients (no appointment_id) are still shown

### For Admin Users:
1. **Shows All Queue Entries**: Admin can see queue entries from all doctors
2. **Full Overview**: Complete view of the entire queue system

## Benefits

✅ **Doctor-Specific View**: Each doctor only sees their own appointments and queue entries  
✅ **Proper Filtering**: No more seeing other doctors' patients  
✅ **Auto-Integration**: Confirmed appointments are automatically added to the queue  
✅ **Walk-in Support**: Walk-in patients are still properly handled  
✅ **Admin Overview**: Admin can still see everything for monitoring  

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. **Login as a Doctor**: Check that only your appointments appear
2. **Check Queue**: Verify only your patients are in the queue
3. **Add Appointment**: Confirm a new appointment and see it auto-added to queue
4. **Walk-in Patient**: Add a walk-in patient and verify they appear in queue
5. **Admin View**: Login as admin to see all queue entries

## Expected Behavior

- **Doctor A** sees only Doctor A's appointments and queue entries
- **Doctor B** sees only Doctor B's appointments and queue entries  
- **Admin** sees all appointments and queue entries from all doctors
- **Confirmed appointments** are automatically added to the queue
- **Queue numbers** reset daily starting from 1
