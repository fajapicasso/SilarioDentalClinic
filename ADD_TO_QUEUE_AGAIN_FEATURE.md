# Add to Queue Again Feature

## Overview
Added a new "Add to Queue Again" button to both Doctor and Staff appointment pages that allows quick re-queuing of patients who were accidentally removed from the queue.

## What Was Added

### 1. Doctor Appointments Page (`src/pages/doctor/Appointments.jsx`)
- ✅ Added "Add to Queue Again" button for confirmed appointments
- ✅ Button only shows when patient is NOT already in queue
- ✅ Prevents duplicate queue entries
- ✅ Uses QueueService for consistent queue management

### 2. Staff Appointments Page (`src/pages/staff/Appointments.jsx`)
- ✅ Added "Add to Queue Again" button for confirmed appointments
- ✅ Same functionality as doctor page
- ✅ Integrated with existing staff workflow

## How It Works

### Button Visibility Rules
- **Only shows for confirmed appointments**
- **Only shows for today's appointments**
- **Only shows when patient is NOT already in queue**
- **Button is disabled while processing**

### Functionality
1. **Checks if patient is already in queue** - prevents duplicates
2. **Uses QueueService** - ensures consistent queue management
3. **Gets next queue number** - follows daily reset logic
4. **Updates UI state** - button disappears after successful addition
5. **Shows success/error messages** - user feedback

### Queue Integration
- **Respects daily reset logic** - queue numbers start from 1 each day
- **Uses Philippine time** - proper timezone handling
- **Prevents duplicates** - checks existing queue entries
- **Maintains appointment link** - connects queue entry to appointment

## Code Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
const [patientsInQueue, setPatientsInQueue] = useState(new Set());
const [isAddingToQueue, setIsAddingToQueue] = useState(false);
```

### Queue Status Checking
```javascript
const checkPatientsInQueue = async () => {
  // Checks which patients are already in today's queue
  // Updates UI state to show/hide buttons appropriately
};
```

### Add to Queue Function
```javascript
const addToQueueAgain = async (appointment) => {
  // Checks for duplicates
  // Uses QueueService to add patient
  // Updates UI state
  // Shows success/error messages
};
```

### Button Implementation
```javascript
{!patientsInQueue.has(appointment.patient_id) && (
  <button
    onClick={() => addToQueueAgain(appointment)}
    disabled={isAddingToQueue}
    className="px-3 py-1 bg-green-600 text-white text-sm rounded hover:bg-green-700 disabled:bg-gray-400"
  >
    {isAddingToQueue ? 'Adding...' : 'Add to Queue Again'}
  </button>
)}
```

## User Experience

### When to Use
- **Patient was accidentally removed from queue**
- **Patient arrived but was marked as absent**
- **Queue entry was deleted by mistake**
- **Patient needs to be re-queued for any reason**

### Button Behavior
- **Green button** - indicates positive action
- **"Adding..." text** - shows processing state
- **Disabled state** - prevents multiple clicks
- **Disappears after success** - prevents duplicate additions

### Success Flow
1. **Click "Add to Queue Again"**
2. **Button shows "Adding..."**
3. **Patient added to queue**
4. **Success message shown**
5. **Button disappears**
6. **Queue updates automatically**

## Benefits

### For Doctors
- ✅ **Quick re-queuing** - one click to add patient back
- ✅ **No duplicate entries** - prevents queue confusion
- ✅ **Visual feedback** - clear button states
- ✅ **Consistent workflow** - integrates with existing process

### For Staff
- ✅ **Same functionality** - consistent across roles
- ✅ **Easy access** - right in appointments page
- ✅ **Error prevention** - duplicate checking
- ✅ **Time saving** - no need to go to queue management

### For System
- ✅ **Data integrity** - prevents duplicate queue entries
- ✅ **Consistent logic** - uses same QueueService
- ✅ **Proper tracking** - audit logs for all actions
- ✅ **Performance** - efficient queue status checking

## Error Handling

### Duplicate Prevention
- **Checks existing queue** before adding
- **Shows info message** if already in queue
- **Prevents multiple additions** with button state

### Error Messages
- **"Patient is already in today's queue"** - duplicate prevention
- **"Patient added to queue as #X"** - success confirmation
- **"Failed to add patient to queue"** - error handling

### Fallback Behavior
- **Button disabled** during processing
- **Error logging** for debugging
- **Graceful degradation** if service fails

## Testing Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. **Patient has confirmed appointment**
2. **Patient is not in queue**
3. **Click "Add to Queue Again"**
4. **Patient added successfully**
5. **Button disappears**
6. **Success message shown**

### Edge Cases
1. **Patient already in queue** - button hidden
2. **Network error** - error message shown
3. **Multiple clicks** - button disabled
4. **Yesterday's appointment** - button not shown

### Error Scenarios
1. **Queue service down** - error handling
2. **Database error** - graceful failure
3. **Permission denied** - appropriate message
4. **Invalid appointment** - validation error

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Bulk re-queuing** - select multiple patients
- **Queue history** - see who was removed when
- **Auto-re-queue** - automatic re-queuing rules
- **Queue analytics** - track re-queue patterns

### Integration Opportunities
- **Notification system** - alert when patient re-queued
- **Audit logging** - track all re-queue actions
- **Reporting** - queue management statistics
- **Mobile support** - responsive design improvements
