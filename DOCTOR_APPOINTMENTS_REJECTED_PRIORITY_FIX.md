# Doctor Appointments - Rejected Priority Fix

## Problem Identified

In the doctor's appointments page, when viewing the "Cancelled/Rejected" tab, the appointments were not properly prioritized. Rejected appointments should be shown first since they require immediate attention, but cancelled appointments were appearing before rejected ones.

## Root Cause

The filtering logic for the "Cancelled/Rejected" tab was only filtering appointments by status but not sorting them by priority. This meant that appointments appeared in the order they were fetched from the database, not in a logical priority order.

## Solution Implemented

### **Enhanced Sorting Logic**

**Before:**
```javascript
} else if (activeTab === 'cancelled') {
  filtered = filtered.filter(app => app.status === 'cancelled' || app.status === 'rejected');
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
} else if (activeTab === 'cancelled') {
  filtered = filtered.filter(app => app.status === 'cancelled' || app.status === 'rejected');
  
  // Sort to show rejected appointments first, then cancelled
  filtered.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a.status === 'rejected' && b.status === 'cancelled') return -1;
    if (a.status === 'cancelled' && b.status === 'rejected') return 1;
    
    // If both have same status, sort by date (newest first)
    const dateA = new Date(`${a.appointment_date}T${a.appointment_time}`);
    const dateB = new Date(`${b.appointment_date}T${b.appointment_time}`);
    return dateB - dateA;
  });
}
```

## How the Sorting Works

### **1. Priority-Based Sorting**
- **Rejected appointments** are shown first (highest priority)
- **Cancelled appointments** are shown after rejected ones
- This ensures doctors see the most critical appointments first

### **2. Secondary Sorting by Date**
- Within each status group (rejected/cancelled), appointments are sorted by date
- **Newest appointments first** for better chronological organization
- Helps doctors see recent rejections/cancellations at the top

### **3. Sorting Logic Breakdown**
```javascript
// Primary sort: Status priority
if (a.status === 'rejected' && b.status === 'cancelled') return -1; // Rejected first
if (a.status === 'cancelled' && b.status === 'rejected') return 1;  // Cancelled second

// Secondary sort: Date (newest first)
const dateA = new Date(`${a.appointment_date}T${a.appointment_time}`);
const dateB = new Date(`${b.appointment_date}T${b.appointment_time}`);
return dateB - dateA; // Newest first
```

## Expected Results

### **Before Fix:**
- Cancelled appointments appeared first
- Rejected appointments were mixed in or appeared later
- No logical priority order
- Hard to identify urgent rejected appointments

### **After Fix:**
- âœ… **Rejected appointments shown first** - Highest priority for immediate attention
- âœ… **Cancelled appointments shown second** - Lower priority but still visible
- âœ… **Newest appointments first** - Within each status group, most recent first
- âœ… **Better workflow** - Doctors can quickly identify and address rejected appointments
- âœ… **Improved organization** - Logical priority-based sorting

## Visual Impact

### **Appointment Order (After Fix):**
1. **Rejected appointments** (newest first)
   - Francis Jey R. Valoria - Rejected (most recent)
   - Other rejected appointments...
   
2. **Cancelled appointments** (newest first)
   - Francis Jey R. Valoria - Cancelled (most recent)
   - Other cancelled appointments...

### **Benefits for Doctors:**
- **Immediate visibility** of rejected appointments requiring attention
- **Better workflow** with priority-based organization
- **Easier decision making** with logical appointment ordering
- **Improved patient care** by addressing rejections first

The doctor's appointments page should now properly prioritize rejected appointments, making it easier to identify and address the most critical appointment issues first! ðŸŽ¯âœ¨
